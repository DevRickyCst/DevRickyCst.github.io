                    <h2 class="section-title blue bold">About me</h2>
                        <p>
                            Passionate about technology and development, I was able to acquire a range of skills that enabled me to strengthen my knowledge of Python in order to develop various applications (Python Package, REST API, Microservice, Website, Chatbot). As I have a strong interest in the Cloud, I've been able to build up my skills on several environments such as AWS and GCP, where I've been able to familiarize myself with and learn from these innovative working methods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Experienced in data engineering, I'm able to set up data processing pipelines using tools such as Airflow or Spark. I'm also familiar with databases, SQL and all aspects of daily data ingestion and processing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Curious and keen to take on new challenges, I'm able to rapidly develop my skills to understand and solve new problems. I'm a self-starter who also knows how to work in a team and use collaborative tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
